## Synopsis 
We have created an app that takes in health data from your phone and syncs the music you are listening to with your heartbeat. Users will link their Spotify accounts and health apps so our app can queue songs for you to listen to. Our vision was that this would be used for exercise, to motivate the intensity of workouts.
