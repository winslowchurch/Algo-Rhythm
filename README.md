## Synopsis 
We have created an app that takes in health data from your phone and syncs the music you are listening to with your heartbeat. Users will link their Spotify accounts and health apps so our app can queue songs for you to listen to. This will be particularly useful for exercising.

- The app will then take a few seconds to fetch all your Spotify playlists. Once fetching is completed, you will be prompted to select one of these playlists to listen to from the drop-down bar. Once you select a playlist, a Submit button will appear. Click it!
